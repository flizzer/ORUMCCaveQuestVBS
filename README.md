#QuestCaveVBS ORUMC 2016 VBS Mobile Apps

Vacation Bible School registration apps for Oak Ridge United Methodist Church

Use a combination of [React-Native] (http://www.reactnative.com), [tcomb-form-native] (https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-form-native), and [Firebase] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) for creating native, cross-platorm, VBS registration apps.  Depends on a custom written web service for emailing registration alerts [ORUMCCaveQuestVBSEmailService] (https://github.com/flizzer/ORUMCCaveQuestVBSEmailService) as well.
